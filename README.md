Graphs and Networks
===================
This repository contains notebooks about graphs algorithms in Python and C.

# Introduction
A graph is represented as a list of nodes, or vertices, and a list of pairs of such nodes called edges. An edge can be directed or undirected, a graph can be cyclic or acyclic. They can be used to represent several real world or abstract objects such as a road or transport network, a social network, the financial network, the world wide web. We can be interested in studying the shortest path between two nodes in terms of the number of edges separating them, or the distribution of connections in the graph, and some statistical moment such as the average number of connections for each node. Graphs can be provided, as in the case of a social or road network, or they can be learnt in probabilistic terms (random graphs), for example by calculating the correlations between variables in a system such as the correlation between the stock prices of firms in a financial market. A network can be static or dynamic. Neural networks can be used to learn a graph, that is computing the probabilities for any two nodes to be connected, from data.
